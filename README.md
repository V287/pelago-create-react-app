# Pelago Create React App

This is a fork of the actual [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) aimed at providing the necessary flexibility needed without losing support from CRA by ejecting it or using wrappers that internally eject CRA like [customize-cra](https://github.com/arackaf/customize-cra)

Currently the app is forked off the `create-react-app v3.4.1`

## Quick Overview

This fork is primarily aimed at exposing one specific package in the repo - `react-scripts`. In future we may go the route of just forking `react-scripts` as a git submodule or a similar approach if there is a clear way to keep updated with the original repo.

Please head to `packages/react-scripts/README.md` to know more about the setup, dev worflow and other information about our version of `react-scripts`
